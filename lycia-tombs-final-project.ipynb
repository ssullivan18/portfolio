    "# Ancient Lycia Necropoleis Type Analysis\n",
    "## Author: Michael Dahlquist, Kristen Qako, & Sean Sullivan\n",
    "\n",
    "In ancient Lycia, rock-cut tombs often clustered together in cemetery sites, or necropoleis, like ancient Myra (modern Demre), illustrated above. This data set contains data about Lycian necropoleis including the number of tombs at each site. You will figure out how many total tombs are represented in the data set. The records describe for each site its name, a typological classification by the Danish scholar Jan Zahle, the number of tombs, an English-language summary, and an identifier in a geographic data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of Notebook:\n",
    "The purpose of this jupyter notebook is to discover how many of each ztype was found in the tomb data. We then export the data to an excel file and created a chart to display our results.\n",

    "### The Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is available as a delimited-text file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaeldahlquist/clas299/master/ancient-lycia-tombs/lycianNecropoleis.cex). The format is one record per row, and columns are delimited by the pound sign (hash tag) `#`. The file includes a header row:\n",
